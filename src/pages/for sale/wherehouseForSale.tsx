        Warehouses in Dubai may be sold to tenants or transferred. However, transferring leases or selling completed facilities requires permission from the Dubai Economic Development Department (DED). It is important to note that this is not a Free Zone, so investors should have a license from the DED before they start investing in the DIP.
